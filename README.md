🔭 Want to be a software developer, lead technical team.

🕵️‍♀️ I like doing quality work over quantity, so I give my precious time to Coding.

🧸 I'm proud of who I am, what I have built, and what I am building.

🧑‍💻 Didn'nt know about Coding till 9 std but now it has become my passion.

📫 I don't like talking.So better to reach me through email @baskeymanoranjan400@gmail.com or call me on 7481848068.

😎 Hobby: Watching movie.

⚡ Fun fact: I laugh a lot lonely because as you know, Laughing is the best medicine.

😢 Biggest mistake: I didn't backup my data and one day, the system crashed and I lost all of my precious data.
